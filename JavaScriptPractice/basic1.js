console.log("Hello World")
//just like System.out.print
// data type is not required but just give var to declare 
// From ES6 engine ..we have variable declaration are 
// let, const
//var or let are same 

let a= 4
let b = 7
console.log(a)
console.log(typeof(a))

let c = "Vikas Kumar"
console.log(typeof(c))
//boolean
let required = true
console.log(typeof(required))
//null and undefined
//We can not redeclare variable with let keyword but possible with var
 c = a+b

c= a+b; //re assign is possible with let
console.log(c)

console.log(typeof(!required))

//const means constant
